Profile readme
# 👋 Hi there! I'm Valerie

I'm a passionate **IT Recruiter** with experience connecting top tech talent with the right opportunities. I work closely with developers, engineers, and tech teams to truly understand what makes a great match — both in skills and culture.

💡 I'm always learning about new technologies and trends in the software development world to improve my sourcing and communication with candidates.

## 🛠️ What I use GitHub for:
- Exploring technologies my candidates work with (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Reviewing public repos to understand developer contributions
- Staying up-to-date with open-source projects and tech communities

## 👀 Looking for:
- Developers who love building cool stuff
- Portfolios, pet projects, or open-source work
- Collaborations with tech teams and hiring managers

📫 Let's connect!  
I'm always open to chatting about opportunities, networking, and cool tech.
